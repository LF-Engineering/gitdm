# YAML format


We are trying to keep that YAML as small as possible, so property names are a bit cryptic and only records containing at least one enrollment and at least one identity are exported:

This is the current format:


```
---
P:                                          # 'profiles' (profile holds possible multiple profile (called identities) from different data sources
                                            # for example git, GitHub, Jira, Slack etc.
- C: PL                                     # profile's 'country code' - if defined must be a correct two letter country code
  E: lukaszgryglicki!o2.pl                  # profile's 'email', all emails have their '@' replaced with '!'
  R:                                        # profile 'enrollments' list, at lease one enrollment must be present
  - T: "2006-03-01"                         # enrollment 'date to' - required
    C: Independent                          # enrollment 'organization' - required
    F: "1970-01-01"                         # enrollment 'date from' - required
(...)
  S: male                                   # profile's 'sex'/'gender'
  I:                                        # profiles 'identities' list (each profile must have source liek git/Jira//Slack), at least one identity must be present
                                            # each source can have multiple identities (multiple profiles, like for example multiple GitHub accounts)
  - E: lukaszgryglicki!o2.pl                # identity's 'email'
    M: Lukasz Gryglicki                     # identity's 'name'
    S: git                                  # identity's 'source' - required (the only required field)
(...)
  - E: lukaszgryglicki!o2.pl                # identity's 'email'
    M: Łukasz Gryglicki                     # identity's 'name'
    S: github                               # identity's 'source'
    U: lukaszgryglicki                      # identity's 'username' - some data sources have it (like GitHub), so doesn't (like git)
  B: 0                                      # profile's bot flag: 0 - normal profile, 1: bot profile
  U: Łukasz Gryglicki                       # profile's name
```
